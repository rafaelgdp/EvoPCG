## PCG for platform games with evolutionary algorithms.

Author: Rafael Guerra de Pontes

### Instructions:

This work was implemented using the Godot Game Engine. Therefore, to run the source code in your machine, you need to download the Godot Mono version 3.2.2 (which was the version primarily used). However, it is expected that it works on any 3.2.X mono version. The Engine is available at www.godotengine.org. In order to use this version of Godot, it is necessary to install the Mono Framework, available at www.mono-project.com. After that, clone this repository and open the project file in the Engine. Run the main scene and the test game will run. It is possible to try different parameters for the GA generation by tweaking the sliders in the test game user interface. If you want to run a batch of simulations with different parameters for the GA, edit them in the MapGeneratorAnalyzer class within the project and run the AnalysisScene scene from the Godot Editor. The data from the simulations will be stored by default in a file called test.csv.
